The game is implemented using pygame library of python. There are several features that was implemented besides the gaming process itself, such as dashboard that is available when pressing the button "m", and user can get back to the gameplay pressing "ESC". Also, user can close the game window on pressing "delete" button. Furthermore, difficulty system was implemented. The game increases falling speed of figures every 8 seconds. Eventually I added plugins such as game sounds and different colors, even though I was not able to assign the colors to specific figures.
